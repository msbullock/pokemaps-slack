# pokemaps-slack

Slack notifications for PokeMaps (https://github.com/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map)


Original PHP Script - https://github.com/wschoot

Modified and Maintained by - https://github.com/tripout

Testing - https://github.com/msbullock


v0.1
============
Added MySQL DB support so the script doesn't fire off Slack Alerts for each re-scanned pokemon if it's already found.

Also cleans up old Pokemon when the script doesn't find a match which should keep the size to a minimum.
